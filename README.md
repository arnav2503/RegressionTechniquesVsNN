# Regression vs. Feedforward Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive study comparing traditional regression models—linear regression for prediction and logistic regression for classification—against feedforward neural networks. The goal is to analyze the performance, interpretability, and scalability of these modeling approaches across various datasets.

## Objectives

- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess and compare metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error (MSE) for each model.
- **Model Complexity**: Explore the complexity of model training, including training times and the impact of hyperparameters.
- **Interpretability Analysis**: Evaluate the interpretability of models, contrasting the clear coefficients of traditional regression with the "black box" nature of neural networks.
- **Scalability Assessment**: Investigate how well each method handles large datasets and captures non-linear relationships.
- **Real-World Applications**: Apply both methods to datasets from healthcare, finance, marketing, and more.

## Getting Started
